# Arithmetic Encoder - AV1

## Description
- This project's goal is to design, verify, and synthesize to ASIC a high-frequency low-power pipelined arithmetic encoder for the AV1 coding standard.
- Currently, this project is comprised of a 3-stage pipeline and generates the Low, Range, and pre-bitstream according to the AV1 reference algorithm.
- As measured in 2020-10-26, this project's frequency, when synthesizing to ASIC, is around **567,85 MHz**.

## What is still missing?
1. **Fix some problems with the carry propagation block ([stage_4.v](https://github.com/tuliopereirab/arithmetic-encoder-av1/blob/master/rtl/entropy-encoder/stage_4.v))**: the stage for is a very detailed and complex block that is still missing one specific exception (receiving _B != 255_ followed by _B == 255_).
2. **Improve frequency and reduce area**: as higher as an architecture's frequency is, there are always ways to make it even higher without increasing the area.

## Project overview
### 4-stage pipeline
- **Stage 1**: Pre-calculations for the Low and Range generation.
- **Stage 2**: The main output is the range ready and normalized, among a few other essential values for the Low generation.
- **Stage 3**: Defines the low value, normalizes it, and generates the pre-bitstream.
- **Stage 4**: Carry propagation block and generation of last 9-bit bitstreams.
### Verification
- This project's testbenches were created in SystemVerilog, and all of them can find any problem with the architecture.
- All files responsible for the verification can be found in the [verification_area](https://github.com/tuliopereirab/arithmetic-encoder-av1/tree/master/verification_area) folder.

#### Simulation data    
- The simulation data files are generated directly from AV1's algorithm, modified to create output files with important data.

##### How to generate?
1. Download the modified file of the AV1's entropy encoder, [entenc.c](https://github.com/tuliopereirab/arithmetic-encoder-av1/blob/master/verification_area/AV1-reference-info/entenc.c);
2. Download/clone the [AV1's reference code](https://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom/);
3. Copy and overwrite the file _entenc.c_ modified into the folder _aom/aom_dsp_;
4. Run any encoding process according to the procedure as specified in the AV1's website;
5. After the encoding process is completed, access the folder *arith_analysis* created;
6. The normal data sequence for the testbench is a file called *main_data*.

##### Other files generated
- **Input**: this file contains only the input values for the architecture. In the case of a testbench, this file cannot be used because it does not contain the algorithm's outputs.
- **Bitstream pre-carry**:
- **Final bitstream**:
#### Testbenches
- **Entropy encoder testbench**: This is the main testbench for the entire archicture. It validades the bitstreams generated and after the carry propagation process. The file is called [entropy_encoder_tb.sv](https://github.com/tuliopereirab/arithmetic-encoder-av1/blob/master/verification_area/testbenches/entropy_encoder_tb.sv)
- **Arithmetic encoder testbench**: This testbench is used to validade only the stages 1, 2 and 3 of the pipeline together. The file is called [tb_arith_encoder.sv](https://github.com/tuliopereirab/arithmetic-encoder-av1/blob/master/verification_area/testbenches/tb_arith_encoder.sv).
- **Pre-bitstream testbench**: This file also verifies the low and range outputs and the bitstream and a few other values used by the function *od_ec_enc_done* on the AV1's original code. The file is called [tb_bitstream](https://github.com/tuliopereirab/arithmetic-encoder-av1/blob/master/verification_area/other_tb/pipeline_sv_csv/tb_bitstream.sv).
- **Component testbenches**: The LZC (Leading Zero Counter) has its own testbench called [tb_lzc.sv](https://github.com/tuliopereirab/arithmetic-encoder-av1/blob/master/verification_area/testbenches/components/tb_lzc.sv).
- **Carry propagation testbench**: The Carry Propagation testbench verifies only the 4th stage of pipeline with random input data and it is called [tb_carry_propagation.sv](https://github.com/tuliopereirab/arithmetic-encoder-av1/blob/master/verification_area/testbenches/components/tb_carry_propagation.sv).

## Architecture in-depth explanation
### Stage 1
- In order to increase frequency, this block executes pre-calculations that are required for both range and low definitions on stages 2 and 3, respectively.
- It also accesses the two look-up tables, which are generated by the script [lut-generator.py](https://github.com/tuliopereirab/arithmetic-encoder-av1/blob/master/Scripts/lut-generator.py).

### Stage 2
- This stage basically uses the results coming from the 1st stage and finds the range initial value.
- Furthermore, this stage normalizes the range using the [LZC.v](https://github.com/tuliopereirab/arithmetic-encoder-av1/blob/master/rtl/entropy-encoder/LZC.v) block.

### Stage 3
- This stage receives values from the stages 1 and 2.
- This stage's main goal is to find the low value and normalize it.
- Moreover, this stage is responsible for generating up to two 9-bit bitstreams per clock cycle.

### Stage 4
- The output bitstreams are 8-bit arrays.
- As Stage 3 generates 9-bit bitstreams, the 4th stage propagates the _b[9]_ to previously generated bitstreams.
- This block is divided in 2 sub-blocks: [carry_propagation.v](https://github.com/tuliopereirab/arithmetic-encoder-av1/blob/master/rtl/entropy-encoder/carry_propagation.v) and [final_bits.v](https://github.com/tuliopereirab/arithmetic-encoder-av1/blob/master/rtl/entropy-encoder/final_bits.v).
- The following subsections explain exactly the blocks' behaviors.

#### Carry Propagation block
- Always when (B_in > 255) -> B_out = B_prev[7:0] + B_in[15:8]
- Therefore, this block will save the last generated 8-bit bistream (B_prev) and propagate the carry of the following bitstreams (B_in).
- B_in = B_prev[7:0] + B_in[15:8]; B_prev = B_in[7:0]
- This block is also able to count the number of 255s received in sequence and release n 255s at the same time using OUT_BIT_2 (255 or 0) and OUT_BIT_3 (number saved in the counter).
- This block is able to release up to five 8-bit arrays when necessary.

#### 255 Exception
- Everytime when 255 is received followed by a number > 255, it is necessary to propagate the carry beyond i-1 (i-2, i-3, i-x).
- To solve this problem, the _bitstream received just before the first 255_ is kept stored within _Bprev_, while a _255_counter_ counts the number of 255 received in sequence.
- Once a bitstream != 255 arrives, the architecture releases as follows: _Bout1_ = _Bprev_; _Bout2_ = 255 or 0; _Bout3_ = _255_counter_; _Bprev_ = _Bin1_ or _Bin2_ (_Bin1_ is release as _Bout4_ if _flagIn_ == 2).

#### Last Bitstreams generation
- When the frame execution is over, it is necessary to release bitstreams according to the _low_ and _cnt_ values.
- This block basically generates up to two bitstreams once the _final_flag_ (sent by the testbench) reaches the Stage 4.
- The bitstreams generated here are also 9-bit arrays and require to pass through the carry propagation process.

## Analysis
### Critical Path
- On 2020-12-19, the frequency reached for a 65nm library synthesis was 559 MHz.
- The architecture's current critical path is the _range_ generation and normalization, which passes through a multiplication and the LZC sub-block.

### Ways to improve
1. Find a way to multiply faster (already did some unsuccessful trials with Vedic multiplication method) -- (_not possible_);
2. Find a way to split the range generation equation and execute some parts in Stage -- (_not possible_)1;
3. Use approximate computing to avoid the multiplication of the range;
4. Find a multiplier-free solution for arithmetic encoding and analyze how it behaves when added to the AV1 reference software (_Window Sliding might be a great option_).

## Versions
1. _entropy-encoder_ is the original architecture comprised by stages 1, 2, 3 and 4, as explained above.
2. _entropy-encoder-lp_ is a low-power version of the architecture. This version uses Operand Isolation and Clock Gating to reduce the power consumption of the architecture. This version aims to prevent useless values from _Boolean Operation_ from being generated and stored.

## How to run the main testbench?
1. Generate the simulation data and generate the LUT data ([lut-generator.py](https://github.com/tuliopereirab/arithmetic-encoder-av1/blob/master/Scripts/lut-generator.py));
2. Import the testbench file [entropy_encoder_tb.sv](https://github.com/tuliopereirab/arithmetic-encoder-av1/blob/master/verification_area/testbenches/entropy_encoder_tb.sv) and change the simulation file's path;
3. Import all _.v_ files;
4. Compile all files in a simulation software (e.g., Modelsim);
5. Use the scripts in folder [verification_area/modelsim_project/scripts/main_entropy_encoder/](https://github.com/tuliopereirab/arithmetic-encoder-av1/tree/master/verification_area/Modelsim/modelsim_scripts/scripts/main_entropy_encoder);
6. With the waveform scripts, some waveforms will be imported to the project (**only tested on Modelsim**);
7. With the [re-run.do](https://github.com/tuliopereirab/arithmetic-encoder-av1/blob/master/verification_area/Modelsim/modelsim_scripts/scripts/main_entropy_encoder/re-run.do) file, the LUT memories will be filled with generated data and the simulation will start.
