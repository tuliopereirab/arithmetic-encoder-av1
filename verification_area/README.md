# Arithmetic Encoder - Verification

## Introduction
	This README aims to provide enough knowledge so anyone and effectively run the verification process for the Arithmetic Encoder (High-throughput or Low-power version). 

## Files

The ([verification_area](link)) comprises several SystemVerilog files that allow different kinds of simulation.

- ([testbenches/entropy_encoder_tb.sv](link)) is a full simulation for the top-module (and thus all the sub-modules);
- ([testbenches/tb_arith_encoder.sv](link)) is a SystemVerilog that only simulates the sub-module 'Arith_Encoder' (this sub-module comprises the pipeline stages 1, 2 and 3);
- ([testbenches/components/](link)) is a directory that comprises testbenches for the different modules found within the repository ((([LZC.v](link)), ([vedic_16x16.v](link)), etc);
- ([add_name_and_link](link)) is a directory that comprises testbenches for each of the architecture's blocks.

## Input Files

All testbenches rely on input data. Sometimes, the input data is randomly generated by the SystemVerilog code itself. However, offenly an input data is required so the testbench and validate the architecture under real world scenarios.

For all testbenches used to validate the architecture's modules (([entropy_encoder_tb.sv](link)), ([tb_arith_encoder.sv](link)) or the individual pipeline stages) the input data can be easily generate using the ([AV1 Reference Software](link)) and the modified ([entenc.c](link)). This execution will generate a .csv file that can be used to simulate the architecture using the testbenches. As one may notice, it'll indeed be necessary for the user to switch the filepaths inside the .sv files.

For testbenches used to validate components that aren't directly related to the AV1 codec (i.e., LZC or Vedic multiplier), the .sv testbenches will randomly generate input values so it can cover a greater area of the architecture and more accurately validate it.
